A large piece of the assessment for the category theory reading course is to do some independent reading and write a report about it. (And also to give a talk.)

As a guideline, the reports should be between 8 and 15 typeset pages, on some material that goes beyond the material covered by the Wednesday talks and the assignments. I'll give some examples and suggestions below, but you're very welcome to come up with your own topics (please run them by me).

There's no expectation you do any original research here; learning some material and giving a nice exposition of it is what I'm looking for. You should write with the rest of the students as the intended audience: make sure that what you write is readily understandable and useful to them. When I read the reports, as well as being confident that you've got the mathematics correct, I want to see evidence that you've thought about how to arrange and explain the material.

(Hopefully this isn't necessary, but past experience suggests it sometimes is --- what you submit must be your original work, and I have little patience for plagiarism. Of course sometimes it can be difficult to imagine how to explain something that you've just learnt differently than the way the source you learnt it did! I expect you to take the time to understand whatever material you are writing about, so that you can come up with your own explanation. At the very least, _please_ don't have your original sources open, or even anywhere close to you, as you are writing.)

We'll discuss exact dates later, but I want to have a two week gap between you submitting a complete final draft, and then resubmission with changes based on my comments. (I'm also happy to look at preliminary drafts even earlier.)

Finally, some suggested topics:
* A version of the adjoint functor theorem.
* Kan extensions.
* Topological quantum field theories as functors from bordisms categories. (Perhaps also the general idea of the cobordism hypothesis?)
* Categorical databases, following David Spivak.
* Quantum group representation categories are braided tensor categories, have a canonical pivotal structure, sometimes are modular, ...
* The (idempotent completion of) Temperley-Lieb is semisimple.
* The equivalence of categories between Temperley-Lieb and U_q(sl_2).
* Monads, monads for adjunctions, monads in computer science.
* Mitchell's embedding theorem for abelian categories.
* Different definitions of semisimplicity.
* Knot polynomials from braided tensor categories (Jones, HOMFLY, Kauffman).
* The Dold-Kan correspondence.
* Presheafs are the free cocompletion.
* Presheafs are canonically colimits of representable presheafs.
* The correspondence between module categories for a monoidal category, and algebra objects inside that monoidal category.
* Beck's monadicity theorem.
* Topos theory
* Model categories
* Monoidal categories are 2-categories with one object, braided monoidal categories are 3-categories with one object and one 1-morphism, ...?
* Drinfeld centre and representation of the annular category.
* Bar-Natan's 3-category of surfaces modulo "neck-cutting" is a categorification of the Temperley-Lieb category.
* ...
