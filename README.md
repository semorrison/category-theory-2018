# category-theory-2018

This is the webpage for the category theory reading course at ANU for 2018. 

The plan
---
Please start reading Tom Leinster's [Basic Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375.pdf).

* Week 1:
    * [Yiming](Week1-Yiming.pdf) will give the unit/counit definition of an adjunction.
    * [Mitchell](Week1-Mitchell.pdf) will talk about some examples of adjunctions.
* Week 2:
    * [Keeley](Week2-Keeley.pdf) will talk about adjunctions as initial objects (this is a more abstract perspective -- please make sure you've grokked already how to use initial objects to describe universal properties)
    * [Josh](Week2-Josh.pdf) will explain what representable functors are.
* Week 3:
    * [Chris](Week3-Chris.pdf) will explain the statement of the Yoneda lemma, and perhaps give an example of it in action.
    * [Likun](Week3-Likun.pdf) will prove the Yoneda lemma.
* Week 4:
    * Adwait will define limits and colimits, and explain that products, equalizers, and pullbacks are special cases.
    * [Yossi](Week4-Yossi.pdf) will explain how to construct limits from products and equalizers.
* Week 5:
    * Roger will explain why if `D` is complete, then `Functor C D` is complete as well.
* Week 6:
    * Zac ?
* Week 7:
    * Yiming will give the definition of a monoidal category, and some examples.
* Week 8:
    * Chris will give the definition and some examples of a braided monoidal category.
* Week 9:
    * Likun will definition functors and natural transformations between monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories.
* Week 10:
    * Zac will define algebras and module objects in a monoidal category `C`, and explain that the category of module objects for an algebra `A` in `C` forms a module category for `C`.
* Week 11:
    * Keeley will explain that monads are algebras in the monoidal category of endofunctors of a category `C`. He may also talk about monads and adjunctions. (Or possibly monads as understood by computer scientists.)
* Week 12:
    * Yossi will define the Drinfeld centre of a monoidal category, and explain that it is braided.

Sources

You might also enjoy watching the [Catster's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters).  A classic book (the early parts of which are quite readable) is MacLane's ''Categories for the working mathematician''. Emily Riehl's book [Category theory in context](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf) is also excellent, and pitched at a slightly higher level. Wikipedia often has quite good content on category theory. The [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) is sometimes a useful source, but you have been warned.


Reports
---
After your presentation, please write a report (at least one page). It should:
* State who was there.
* Indicate the material you covered in your presentation.
* Note any difficulties or confusions that arose, particularly those that were not resolved in discussion with the group.
* Indicate the topics covered in the discussion after the presentation.
* Evaluate your presentation of the material. Could you have arranged things differently, to better aid understanding? Was there too much or too little technical detail? Did you facilitate a constructive discussion after the presentation? Any other comments?

Grading
---
* a report on your class presentation (10%)
* four written assignments (10% each, for 40% total)
* a final essay (approx. 10 pages, on a topic of your choice related to the material we cover) (35%)
* a final presentation (by default, on the same topic as your final essay) (15%)

Assignments
---
The assignment problems will be posted [here](https://github.com/semorrison/category-theory-2018/blob/master/Assignments.pdf). 
The first batch of problems is due at the end of week 3, the second batch is due at the end of week 6. 

Meeting Times
---
* Monday 3-4: Assignment questions discussion
* Wednesday 1-2: Presentation and discussion
* Friday 12-1:30: Q&A/Lecture with Scott
